## **Scrum Master Role**

In the Computer Science portion of the curriculum you have learned a number of skills that help make you a stronger developer. You have more experience solving difficult problems and more general knowledge on how computing systems work from the ground up. You will be responsible primarily for the deployment of the different pieces of the project, The Marketing Site, The Client Side App and the Back End API. 

## The  **`Computer Science Unit or Lambda Labs` has taught you thus far some of the following skills:**

- You are a generalist developer
- You have the ability to solve problems that you don't know how to solve, or research solutions to problems you don't know how to tackle.
- You know how to work as a leader and have demonstrated abilities to guide students along the way.

## **Your Primary Role as a Scrum Master**

You, yourself, will have pieces of the project to work on. Additionally, your problem solving skills can be brought to bear across many of the project's subsystems, so be available to help anywhere you can. You might have your hands in a lot of different source files. If the project schedule permits it, push your boundaries and set up something more advanced like CI/CD.

IMPORTANT: You're not the manager or boss; you are equal in rank to your teammates. Your job is to serve and enable the other members of the team (and yourself!) to do work more effectively.

## **Instructions**
